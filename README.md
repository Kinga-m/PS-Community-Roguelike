Game plan:

Roguelike games are extremely varied, but have several tropes in common with each other.
- Single-player
- Text-based (no graphics, instead game world is represented with terminal characters)
- Simple plot ("Go here, kill this, retrieve treasure")
- Permadeath
- Turn-based
- Randomly-generated dungeons
- Emphasis on gameplay over graphics
- Usually contains magic skills

This should give you an idea what type of game this will be. Think text-based Diablo.

Game will feature character creation at start. Just type in a name for now (?).

Characters will obtain skills as user levels up. Can choose to use skills or not, providing simple implementation of a flexible class system.

Need to make class for character. Separate file? Separate file.

Main file is game.cpp.
