TODO:
- agree on a programming language!
- assign assignments
- make main file
- plan out base aspects of game

Game plan:

Roguelike games are extremely varied, but have several tropes in common with each other.
- Single-player
- Text-based (no graphics, instead game world is represented with terminal characters)
- Simple plot ("Go here, kill this, retrieve treasure")
- Permadeath
- Turn-based
- Randomly-generated dungeons
- Emphasis on gameplay over graphics
- Usually contains magic skills

This should give you an idea what type of game this will be. Think text-based Diablo.
